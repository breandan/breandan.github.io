title: A Practical Guide to ML Research
---

Recently, several people have asked me for advice how to get into machine learning research. I will try to highlight some skills and resources which have broad applicability, or those I have found personally useful. I believe there are a few categories of skills that will help you to be productive as a researcher, and if you come from a non-traditional CS background, it's not a barrier to doing research.

# Theoretical

There are an abundance of theoretical resources for machine learning theory. Many use different notation, or are simply very dense.

* [A Brief Introduction to Machine Learning for Engineers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02840.pdf) by [Osvaldo Simeone](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/osvaldo.simeone/index.htm)
* [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/910e/3118b50f426e5e840561e1f9f1fdd67e5724.pdf) by [Garrett Thomas](https://gwthomas.github.io/)
* [Foundations of Data Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book.pdf) by Arvim Blum, John Hopcroft and Ravindran Kannan.
* [Matrix Calculus for Machine Learning](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html) by Terrence Parr and Jeremy Howard.
* [The Matrix Cookbook](https://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/edoc_download.php/3274/pdf/imm3274.pdf)
* [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw). I can't emphasize how well this material is put together. Particularly the Linear Algebra and Machine Learning series.


# Programming

* [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do) by Aurélien Géron - If you want to learn TensorFlow, this is really the best book out there. Aurélien also has a great [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCvGd1WBMpFQ_vtC89VF2qA).
* Learn [NumPy](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100/blob/master/100%20Numpy%20exercises.md) with some [exercises](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/101-numpy-exercises-python/) for sharpening your NumPy-foo.
* [Pandas Cookbook](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/cookbook.html)

# Research Papers

* [How to Read a Paper](https://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf)

There are lots of great tools out there. One of the good things about the internet is the number of of resources available to learn from.  I've had several people ask me
