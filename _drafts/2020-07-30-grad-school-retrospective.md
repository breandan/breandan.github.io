title: My Journey into Academia

---

Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at McGill University, under the supervision of Jin Guo. The following blog post describes my journey to grad school, which I have decided to put into writing while my memory is still fresh. It is a hastily written, mostly unfiltered account, so if you're curious about graduate school or what academic research is like, this is my best recollection of how that journey came about. I'm not the best role model, but a few people have asked me about this, so I will do my best to paint an accurate picture for those who are curious.

Following some recent events, I have been reflecting on the role of luck and merit in life. Unfortunately, these quantities far too unevenly in our society. Anyone who knows me knows I am one of the luckiest people alive. Lest you think I am responsible for any of this good fortune, I will be the first to admit that I have received a undeservedly large amount of goodwill, for what reason I know not. I have tried to credit the role of luck in my journey. I hope you too are forgiven your failures and follow your dreams like I have been able to do.

In 2014, I was hired as a evangelist, where I learned to how to teach tech tools. For some reason, people paid me to write code on stage. I was never particularly good at this. But I got to meet some amazing people and did some half-decent writing. Learned a lot about developer tools and the tech industry in general. The way tech conferences work is that you write a few paragraphs about a technology and submit a talk outline. Someone looks at it and decides whether or not to accept it. Some conferences cover travel, room and board. There are other parts to the job, but that's the basic idea.

Sometime around 2016, I realized I didn't have the faintest clue about what I was talking about. I wanted to learn! So I tried applying to some graduate schools, but in order to get into grad school in the US, you need to take a bunch of tests and have academic letters of reference. So I quit my job to run [around the world](http://breandan.net/2016/12/27/traveling-tales/) giving talks about machine learning. Along the way, I ran into Yoshua at the United Nations, who suggested studying in Canada. I applied to UofT and UdeM and landed at UdeM because I hate asking people for recommendations, and they were the only ones who didn't care about them anyway. One of the best decisions I made. Move to Montréal, thank me later.

I landed in Montreal in the Summer of 2017, which was then at the height of the [AI fever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVXkISpbq2k). There were meetups and startups and signups for every imaginable thing that could be remotely described as AI. Some friends and I joined a hackathon one weekend and they gave us an award for a hypothetical startup and flew everyone to Paris. They had a good idea and worked hard for it, I mostly did some cheerleading.

In the Fall of 2017, I took a class on applied machine learning at McGill, which was a wonderful experience. I met a lot of talented young people with big dreams. The lectures were packed with hundreds of us, take notes in the aisles. I'm sure it was stressful at the time, but all I can remember was how thrilling it was to be back in school again where nobody knew my name and the future was a blank page.

I asked a bunch of professors to let me do research. They all declined, but then I tried again and one had a change of heart. So I became a master's student. I joined an energetic young lab at UdeM working on robotics and software engineering. If that's something that interests you, check them out! They're doing fantastic work.

In 2018, I decided to take three classes on machine learning theory, representation learning and reinforcement learning at once. This was a mistake in hindsight, but I loved every moment of it. I learned about attention, statistical methods, convergence rates of stochastic gradient descent and Polyak's heavy ball method. I learned about Q-learning, Bellman equations and This was all new to me and I enjoyed it very much. But by then, my heart was on automatic differentiation.

In Summer 2018, I was given the opportunity to work as an robotics intern in either Silicon Valley or Boston. I decided to work in Boston on autonomous vehicles. The autonomous vehicles industry is a tough space with a lot of competition. I was working on software automation, which is pretty simple by comparison. Had a great time in Boston. Worked next to some brilliant engineers, who were all under a lot of stress to deliver results.

I returned to Montreal that Fall to present our work at the AI Symposium together with my colleagues. This went pretty well, mostly to their credit. I was fortunate in that the work I did there was able to be open sourced and turned into infrastructure for the class and later an autonomous vehicles competition, which we presented the next winter. It was stressful, but also very gratifying to see people smile.

UdeM is a very happy-go-lucky place in general. Almost everyone I met there was cheerful and lighthearted. After spending a very fruitful two years at UdeM, I knew I wanted to stay in school. But something told me if that if I wanted to continue my research I would need to find a new home. Hoping to stay in Montreal, I knocked on half a dozen doors and following some productive conversions with folks whose work I admired, I asked Dr. Guo if she would take me on as a student. And she said yes!

Summer of 2019 rolled around and I started attending conferences again. IROS, ICSE, ICML, OPLSS, ICFP. This was one long string of programming activities.

After a summer of conferences and workshops, I returned to Montreal with a bunch of new ideas. Fall 2019 hit like a tornado. I decided to take two seminars in software engineering and topology. Polish spaces, Kantorovich-Rubenstein duality, σ-algebras. This was all above my head. Then, disaster struck - my thesis went into major revisions, and would need another chapter to finish. It would take another few months to sort this all out and I ended up failing the topology class. What a nightmare!

In the Spring, I took an amazing class on graph theory, which gave me a lot of new ideas. This is something I want to work on for the next decade or more. There's a bunch of good theory and is grounded in good old fashioned software engineering.

Halfway through, disaster struck again! Global pandemic and quarantine. This was a blessing in disguise, in hindsight. Instead of running around the city to and fro, I had a few more productive hours each day, which helped me narrow down research ideas and refocus.

One of the many things I admire about Jin is her tireless work ethic. As a mother of two, she teaches two full courses a year, referees conferences and workshops, does a ton of service. She has never missed a single beat. Not once. I have never once asked for a meeting and felt as though I did not have her full and undivided attention. Over the last year, we spent 3-4 hours a week together in classes and meetings. Someday I hope to be as focused and productive as this professor is every day.

UdeM and McGill are both special places, but also different places. Primarily, the lingua franca. But also the research and academic culture. The CS department at McGill is a lot more crowded and has a lot more people in general.
