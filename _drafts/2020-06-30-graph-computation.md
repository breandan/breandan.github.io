# New decade, new delusions

Over the last decade, I bet on some strange ideas. A lot of the people I looked up to at the time laughed at me. I'll bet they aren't laughing anymore. I ought to thank them one day, because their laughter gave me a lot of motivation over the years.

In 2012, I was in Austin sitting next to an ex-poker player named [Amir](https://twitter.com/amirpc) who was excited about Hinton's work. I poured over his technicolor slides and something must have clicked, because I quit my job in a hurry and started [an educational project](http://breandan.net/2014/02/09/the-end-of-illiteracy/) using speech recognition and restricted Boltzman machines. It never panned out, but I learned a lot about speech recognition and Android audio. Still love that idea.

In 2016, I quit my next job as a tech evangelist to [run around the world](http://breandan.net/2016/12/27/traveling-tales/) giving incoherent talks about deep learning. I met Yoshua at the United Nations. He encouraged me to study in Canada. I applied to UofT and UdeM. Ended up at UdeM because I hate asking for recommendations, and they were the only ones who didn't care about them anyway. Best decision I ever made. Move to Montreal, thank me later. 

In 2017, I started writing a book on the ethics of automation and [predicted](http://breandan.net/2017/02/02/trust-in-automation/) mass unemployment and social unrest. Although I got the causes wrong (pandemic, go figure), the information economy and bias takes were all dead right. Sadly, the worst parts came true faster than I imagined and are now driving the world completely insane. Don't thank me, go out and fix our broken systems. The world needs more engineers who care.

In 2017, I witnessed the birth of differentiable programming, which I stole from Chris Olah and turned into a [master's thesis](https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf). Had a lot of trouble convincing people that programs could be made differentiable, but look at the proceedings of any machine learning conference today and you'll find dozens of papers on differentiable sorting and rendering and simulation. [Types](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/12345) are [coming](https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html#pep-585-builtin-generic-types). Don't thank me, thank Chris and the Theano guys.

In 2018, I bet on big code and ML4SE. This was pretty clear to a lot of people, but I correctly predicted Microsoft would acquire GitHub to mine code. Why MS and not Google? I'll bet they tried, but Google's leadership had fantasies of AGI and besides JetBrains, MS were the only ones who cared about developers. Now ML4SE is a thriving research area and showing up in [real](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/DeepBugsPlugin) [products](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ai-assisted-intellisense-for-your-teams-codebase/).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prediction: MS will acquire GH within five years. If the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ML4Code?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ML4Code</a> stuff delivers for MS, acquisition is highly likely. Although it would have been cheaper a few years ago. <a href="https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD">https://t.co/5ZMtiRtifD</a> <a href="https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps">https://t.co/TaxkArm5ps</a></p>&mdash; breandan (@breandan) <a href="https://twitter.com/breandan/status/993553301927936001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This year, I predicted the pandemic weeks before the lockdown, exited the market, and turned down a job at Google. Some people called me crazy. Now I'm going all-in on some new ideas (none of which are mine). I'm making some big bets and some may be wrong, but I see the very same spark of genius in them. Hang on to your hats, because if I'm right, these things are going to shake the foundations of modern computing.

# Everything old is new again

As a kid, I was given a book on the history of mathematics. I remember it had some interesting puzzles, including one with [some bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg) crossing a town divided by rivers, solved by a man called Euler. Which towns had a path crossing each bridge exactly once? Was it possible to tell without checking every path? I remember spending days drawing to figure out the puzzle.

In the late 90s, my mom and I went to Ireland. I remember visiting Trinity College, and learning about a mathematician called [Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton) who discovered a famous formula connecting algebra and geometry, and carved it onto a [bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom_Bridge). We later visited the bridge, and the tour guide pointed out the stone, which we touched for good luck. The Irish have a [thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poulnabrone_dolmen) for [stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange).

[![](../images/quaternions.jpg)](http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EMIS/classics/Hamilton/PRIAIcos.pdf)

In 2007, I was applying to college and took the train from Boston to South Bend, Indiana, home of the Fighting Irish. Wandering about, I found a magazine article by a Hungarian mathematician called [Barab√°si](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Barab%C3%A1si) who had some interesting things to say about "[complex networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_network)". Later in 2009, while studying in Rochester, I [carpooled](../images/complex_network_seminar.png) with a [nice professor](https://avesis.medeniyet.edu.tr/hasan.guclu), and learned complex networks are found in brains, languages, social networks and many marvelous places.

[![](../images/complex_networks.png)](https://barabasi.com/f/226.pdf)


Fast forward to 2017. I was listening to some folks working on algorithmic differentiation. Olivier Breleux presented [Myia](https://github.com/mila-iqia/myia) and [Buche](https://github.com/breuleux/buche). Matt Johnson gave a talk on [Autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd). I met Chris Olah in Long Beach, who gave me the idea to study [differentiable programming](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/). I stole his idea, dressed it up in Kotlin and traded it for a POPL workshop paper and later a [Master's thesis](https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/blob/master/latex/thesis/thesis.pdf). Our contributions were algebra, shape inference and presenting AD as term rewriting. But forget all that -- if I had only one idea to share with these ML people, it would be types. Types are the best tool we know for synthetic reasoning.

[![](https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad/raw/master/samples/src/main/resources/dataflow.svg)](https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad#dataflow-graphs)

In 2019, I joined a lab with a [nice professor](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jguo/) at McGill applying knowledge graphs to software engineering. Like types, knowledge graphs are an old idea from the first wave of AI in the 1960s and 70s which have been revived and studied in light of recent progress in representation learning on graphs. I believe this is an important area of research with a lot of potential. Knowledge and traceability plays an important role in software engineering, and it's the bread-and-butter of a good IDE. The world needs better IDEs if we're ever going to untangle this mess we're in.

[![Structurizr](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cecuesta/structurizr-java/master/docs/images/graphviz-spring-petclinic-components.png)](https://structurizr.com/)

This Spring, I took a fascinating [seminar on Graph Representation Learning](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/comp766/index.html). A lot of delightful graph theory had been worked out over the preceding decade. [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) turned into power iteration. People made lots of interesting connections to linear algebra, including Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernels, graph Laplacians and spectral graph theory. The idea here is there are some elegant mathematics for representing graphs, and choosing the right representation can be very powerful. More on that later.

# What are graphs?

Graphs are general-purpose data structures used to represent many data types and procedural phenomena. Consider the following hierarchy of data structures, all of which are graphs with increasing structure:

- **Sets**: datasets, multisets, posets, alphabets
- **Sequences**: Lists, strings, arrays, linear function composition
- **Trees**: [Abstract syntax trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree), [document object models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model), [phylogenic trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree), [decision trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree)
- **DAGs**: [Git](https://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/), [citation networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_network), [dependency graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_graph), [workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow_management_system), [control flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph), [MLPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron)
- **Directed graphs**: [State machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine), [lambda calculus](http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/), [web pages](https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/The_web_as_a_directed_graph), [call graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph), [RNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network)
- **Hypergraphs**: [Knowledge graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02320.pdf), [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/), [categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory), [the universe](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/04/finally-we-may-have-a-path-to-the-fundamental-theory-of-physics-and-its-beautiful/), [hypernetworks](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rkpACe1lx)

Graphs are useful for representing mathematical expressions as I show in [Kotlin‚àá](https://github.com/breandan/kotlingrad). Graphs are also used to represent other types of symbolic data, including source code, intermediate representations and markup languages. There are many recent examples of learning graphs for symbolic applications:

* [Deep Learning for Symbolic Mathematics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01412)
* [Discovering Symbolic Models from Deep Learning with Inductive Biases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11287.pdf)
* [Symbolic Pregression: Discovering Physical Laws from Raw Distorted Video](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11212.pdf)
* [DreamCoder: Growing generalizable, interpretable knowledge with wake-sleep Bayesian program learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08381.pdf)

Graphs have many applications for modeling natural language, such as parsing [constituency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar) and [dependency grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar), [link grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar) and others lexical structures. Research begun to show many useful applications for semantic parsing in the extraction and representation of human knowledge in large text corpora.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Thistreeisillustratingtherelation%28PSG%29.png)

Using entity resolution techniques from NLP, we can reconstruct logical relations between entities. These relationships can be stored in [knowledge graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02320.pdf), and used for information retrieval and question answering, e.g. on wikis and other web based content management systems. Recent techniques have shown a lot of promise in automatic knowledge base construction using e.g. logical forms (cf. [Reddy et al.](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/tacl_a_00088), 2016).

<!--![logical_forms](../images/logical_forms.png) -->
![](../images/knowledge_graph.png)

Lo and behold, the key idea behind knowledge graphs is our old friend, types. Knowledge graphs are graphs whose nodes and edges have a type. We can build index data based on a type, which is useful for information retrieval, and use types to reasoning about complex queries which would otherwise be difficult to model directly, e.g. "Which companies have a direct flight from a port city to a capital city?"

# Graphs, inductively

One thing has always fascinated me is the idea of inductively defined languages. Consider a very simple language with the following grammar. We read the `|` character as "or":

```
<true> ‚Üí 1
<term> ‚Üí 0 | 10 | Œµ
<expr> ‚Üí <term> | <expr> <term>
```

Notice how each non-terminal occurs at most once in any single production. This property guarantees the language is recognizable by a special kind of graph, called a finite state machine. As their name indicates, FSMs contain a finite number of states, with labeled transitions between them:

|Finite State Machine | Library Courtesy Bell |
|--------|--------|
|![](../images/fsm_bell.svg)| ![](../images/bell.png)<br/>Please ring the bell **once** and wait for assistance. |

Imagine a library desk: you can wait quietly and eventually you will be served. You can ring the bell once, and wait to be served. Should no one arrive, you may press the bell again and continue waiting. Though you must never ring the bell twice, or you will disturb the patrons and be tossed out.

Now, let us consider a slightly more expressive language. This time, a nonterminal occurs twice in a single production -- an `<expr>` can be composed of two shorter `<expr>`s:

```
<term> ‚Üí x | y | z | 0
<op>   ‚Üí + | - | ¬∑ | /
<expr> ‚Üí <term> | <op> <expr> | <expr> <op> <expr>
```

This is known as a context-free language (CFL). We can represent strings in this language using a special kind of graph, called a syntax tree. Each time you expand an `<expr>` with a production rule, this generates a rooted subtree on `<op>`, whose leaves are `<expr>`s.

|Syntax Tree| Peach Tree|
|-----------|-----------|
|![](../images/tree_syntax.svg)|![](../images/tree_peach.png)|
 
Now suppose we introduce the following rules to this grammar. Instead of just allowing strings on the right, we can also have strings to the left, and applying a rule can shrink the string:

```
t + t ‚Üí +t
t - t ‚Üí 0
```

This is known as a recursively enumerable language, or string rewrite system. This particular example produces directed acyclic graphs. Some people say that all trees are DAGs, but not all DAGs are trees. Growing up in the woods, I prefer to think of DAGs as trees with a gemel:

|Rewrite Rule|Deformed Tree|
|---|----|
|![](../images/tree_dag.svg)|![gemel](../images/tree_gemel.png)|
|![](../images/tree_dag_minus.svg)|![gemel](../images/stump.png)|

Let us again introduce some new rules to our grammar, which operate on computation graphs. We introduce a new operator, `D‚Çì`, and apply the rules to transform the graph:

```
          <term> ‚Üí D‚Çì(<term>)
(R1)       D‚Çì(x) ‚Üí 1                  
(R2)       D‚Çì(y) ‚Üí 0                  
(R3)     D‚Çì(u+v) ‚Üí D‚Çì(u) + D‚Çì(v)      
(R4)     D‚Çì(u¬∑v) ‚Üí u¬∑D‚Çì(v) + D‚Çì(u)¬∑v  
```

Each rule is a rewriting operator. Here, we assign an ordering `R1`-`R4` for notational convenience, but regardless of the order of application, they will always produce the same result.

|Term Confluence|Ottawa-St. Lawrence Confluence|
|:---:|:---:|
|![](../images/confluence_term.svg)|![](../images/confluence_river.png)|

This propery, called [confluence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluence_(abstract_rewriting)), is an important property for rewrite systems. Furthermore, all strings in this language will converge to a form which can be simplified no further, called its normal form. We call such systems *strongly normalizing*.

Similarly, it is possible to define graphs themselves inductively, using algebraic data types:

```
type Node        = Int
type Adj b       = [(b, Node)]
type Context a b = (Adj b, Node, a, Adj b)
type Graph a b   = Empty | Context a b & Graph a b
```

Another definition of a graph is an adjacency matrix containing nodes V and edges E, where:

<span class='mathquote'>$$
\begin{align*}
    \mathbf A \in \mathbb \mathbb B ^{|V|\times|V|} \text{ where } \mathbf A\[u, v\] =
    \begin{cases}
       1,& \text{if } u, v \in E \\
       0,& \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$</span>

Graph grammars are grammars on graphs.

# Graphs, visually

Consider the [elementary cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton), which consists of a one dimensional array, and a 3-cell rewrite grammar. There are 2<sup>2<sup>3</sup></sup>=256 rules for rewriting the tape. It turns out even in this simple space, there are remarkable automata. Consider the following rewrite system:

![Rule 110](../images/ca_rule%20110.png)

<!--![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton#/media/File:One-d-cellular-automate-rule-30.gif)-->

<!--We can represent this using graphs:-->

<!--![image](../images/ca_rule30.png)-->



<!--| current pattern           | `111` | `110` | `101` | `100` | `011` | `010` | `001` | `000` |-->
<!--|:-------------------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:----:|-->
<!--| new pattern | ` 0 `  | ` 1 `  | ` 1 `  | ` 0 `  | ` 1 ` | ` 1 `  | ` 1 `  | ` 0 `  |-->


This system is equivalent to a [Turing machine](https://wpmedia.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/13/2018/02/15-1-1.pdf). Consider the Œª-calculus, another Turing complete system. It consists of the following rules:

```
<expr> := <name> | <func> | <appl>
<func> := Œª <name>.<expr>
<appl> := <expr><expr>
```

```
Œªx.M[x]  ‚Üí Œªy.M[y]    (Œ±-conversion)
(Œªx.M) E ‚Üí M[x := E]  (Œ≤-reduction)
```

The lambda calculus can also be represented graphically. I refer the gentle reader to these interesting proposals:

* [Graphic lambda calculus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.5786.pdf)
* [Visual lambda calculus](http://bntr.planet.ee/lambda/work/visual_lambda.pdf)
* [To Dissect a Mockingbird: A Graphical Notation for the Lambda Calculus](http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/)

Graphs have found many interesting applications as reasoning devices in various sciences:

One way to visualize a graph is a boolean matrix.

|Graph | Matrix |
|------|--------|
|![](../images/ld_graph_dot.svg)|![](../images/ld_graph_mat.png)|

Note its lower diagonal structure, indicating there are no cycles, which is not immediately obvious from the visual appearance. Note also its sparsity, indicating the number of present and missing edges. While graph layout techniques is an active area of research, matrices can often reveal symmetries that are not obvious from a naive graph layout.

However matrices have some disadvantages. Notably, we impose an ordering over all nodes. This is problematic for isomorphism. Also note the size of the matrix. This can also be problematic. More on that later.

I strongly suspect these representations are not only useful as cognitive aides, but are effective data structures for performing computation.

# Graphs, computationally

What happens if we define some operators on graphs, such as addition and multiplication? How would we do that, and what does it mean?

Naively, a directed graph is just a square boolean matrix whose values indicate edges between nodes. Just like real matrices in linear algebra, we can add, subtract, multiply and exponentiate them.

One interesting game mathematicians like to play is taking a square matrix R^2 and raise it to a power. There are various tricks for designing the matrix and normalizing the product so it does not explode or vanish. This game has many important applications in control theory, dynamical systems and machine learning (RNNs).

Another interesting game that mathematicians like to play is to take iterated matrix-vector products. One way to think about this is MMMV. Another way is M(M(M(V))), where M is a function on a vector space. These are equivalent. As Tae Danae Bradley [vividly portrays](https://www.math3ma.com/blog/matrices-probability-graphs), matrices are not just 2D arrays, matrices are *functions on a vector spaces*.

It turns out the very same idea is not just valid for R^2, but can be applied to B^2, Z^2 and has many interesting connections to graph theory and automata.

Suppose we want to simulate an automata. All of these automata can be evolved using matrix multiplication!

# Graphs, efficiently

One issue with efficient representation of graphs is space complexity. Suppose we have a graph with 10<sup>5</sup>=100,000 nodes, but only a single edge. We will need 10<sup>5*2</sup> bits, or about 1 GB to store it in adjacency matrix form, whereas if we use an adjacency list, we will need only ‚åà 2\*log<sub>2</sub>10<sup>5</sup> ‚åâ = 34 bits. Most graphs are similarly sparse. But how do you multiply adjacency lists? Unclear. The solution is to use sparse matrices. That was easy.

Another, thornier, problem with graph algorithms is their time complexity. Many interesting problems on graphs are NP-complete, including Hamiltonian paths and subgraph isomorphism. If so, how are we supposed to do any computation if every operation may take nondeterminstic polynomial time? Computer science people are mostly concerned with worst case complexity, which is practically never going to happen. Real world graphs can be solved quickly using approximate algorithms, such as Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm. My colleague David Bieber has a nice [blog post](https://davidbieber.com/post/2019-05-10-weisfeiler-lehman-isomorphism-test/) about this. I'll focus on the implementation.

First, we need a pooling operator, which aggregates all neighbors on a vertex's ego graph:

```kotlin
fun <R> poolBy(op: Set<Vertex>.() -> R): Map<Vertex, R> =
  nodes.map { it to op(it.neighbors()) }.toMap()
```

Next we need a histogram operator, which simply counts how many neighbors each node has. This is the degree matrix, sparisfied:

```kotlin
val histogram: Map<Vertex, Int> by lazy { poolBy { size } }
```

Now we're ready to define the Weisfeiler-Lehman operator, which recursively computes a hash on the histogram for `k` steps.

```kotlin
tailrec fun wl(k: Int, labels: Map<Vertex, Int>): Map<Vertex, Int> =
  if (k <= 0) labels
  else wl(k - 1, poolBy { map { labels[it]!! }.sorted().hashCode() })
```

The hashcode of the entire graph is the hash code of the WL labels. With one round, we're just comparing the degree historgram. The more rounds we use, the more likely it is to detect a symmetry breaking issue:

```kotlin
override fun Graph.hashCode(steps: Int = 10) = 
    wl(steps, histogram).values.sorted().hashCode()
```

Now we can define an isomorphism test to if one graph is isomorphic to entire graph:

```kotlin
fun Graph.isIsomorphicTo(that: Graph) =
  nodes.size == that.nodes.size && 
  numOfEdges == that.numOfEdges && 
  hashCode() == that.hashCode()
```

Now we're done. This algorithm works on almost every graph you will ever encounter. That was easy!

We can encode a program as a graph.

A lot of the stuff in Graph Representation Learning is motivated by computational constraints. You can't instantiate the adjacency matrix, because it's too large, so you need all kinds of mathematical tricks to sum over or approximate it. But most graphs are sparse and have all kinds of symmetries. Finding the right graph embedding can get you real far...
