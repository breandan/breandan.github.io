title: Tales of a Traveling Developer

---

Earlier this year, I decided to go on a sabbatical. Since then, I have spent time in many interesting places - some for work, some for conferences, some just for the sheer hell of it. As the year is ending, I thought I would share parts of my journey. Perhaps you may wish to go to some of these places. Some of them, you will not.

In January of 2016, I visited the sister of a Brother who lives in Phoenix. She kindly showed me the city where she had recently relocated from somewhere in Long Island. We ate breakfast at the [Breakfast Club](http://www.breakfastclub.us/), and looked for a relative who drowned in the attack on Pearl Harbor. In the middle of their city they have planted a [huge gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Bolin_Memorial_Plaza) for the lost sailors of the Battleship Arizona.

In February, I flew to Atlanta, and was promptly greeted by a cheerful Hawaiian professional photographer, turned recreational Uber driver, who gave a white kid tips for how to survive on the streets of Atlanta over Italian pasta. I think he took pity on me sitting in the backseat of his BMW. Besides [the bomb evacuation](http://www.cbs46.com/story/31337956/suspicious-package-found-under-car-in-downtown-atlanta) at DevNexus, it was a pretty nice trip.

Later that month, I boarded [Adirondack #69](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondack_(train)) from New York to Montreal for [ConFoo](https://confoo.ca/en). After running for miles in the freezing sleet, wondering what I was doing with my life and nearly succumbing to hypothermia, I met some incredibly kind people, including a friend from Brasil, the organizers, a [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/idea/plugin/7896-markdown-navigator) developer, and lots of Canadians. Great conference.

Shortly after, I drove down to [EclipseCon](https://www.eclipsecon.org/na2016/event/619) in Washington, DC, where I met some friendly people from [a top-secret Russian laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJOpNss7tCQ), Goldman Sachs, and a couple of lawyers for the CFTC (all completely unrelated). I also had a chance to visit the National Basilica, a gigantic statue of Albert Einstein and the Museum of Natural History. Go there.

In April I had a layover in Hong Kong and decided to get Dim Sum. Instead, I wandered around and got caught in a thunderstorm. So I did what anyone would normally do and climbed the tallest mountain I could find. After nearly dying of electrocution, the stormclouds parted and I caught a glimpse of the sprawling cyberpunk nirvana that is Greater Hong Kong.

The rain started back up again, so I ducked into an empty church to dry off. Suddenly, there a great commotion - hundreds of children, dripping and tripping all over the place. They came in busses and bunches, shuffling onto the benches. Thunder and pouring rain. Umbrellas and coats. Candles everywhere. Then, they began to sing. I never heard anything so beautiful.

Landing in Bangalore, I was greeted by the sound of pandemonium. Bangalore is the tech capital of India, and I was here to work. After a long series of business meetings, chasing down deliveries, hailing three-wheeled contraptions, and drinking my weight in water every day, I felt cautiously prepared for the ensuing conference festivities.

Our tiny booth was quickly overwhelmed by a multitude of curious people. And from dawn to dusk, we shook hands, we gave away shirts, we held quizzes. Following an amazing culinary extravaganza and near-death experience with food-poisoning on MG Road, I am convinced Indian food, like all delicious things, is best consumed in moderation.

Two of my colleagues took it upon themselves to personally drive me around Bangalore, broker steaming cups of tea from passing chaiwallas, order samosa, vada pav, and chats from busy street vendors, visit parliamentary buildings, gold-laden temples, purchase a saree, navigate massive thoroughfares and narrow alleyways, negotiate access to gated compounds.

Two things stand out in my mind. Indian enthusiasm is contagious. As a North American, my people are cool, reserved. We work hard, and complain a lot. Indians are hard working, and will happily talk to you about anything under the sun. I guess everyone is the same, everyone is different. But I am deeply grateful for their kindness.

After a brief stint in Dharavi, Mumbai, I flew back to New York with a new set of problems. So I decided to ignore them and go for a prolonged bike trip through the Pacific Northwest. Turns out that was just a different set of problems. I took the Amtrak Cascades from Seattle to Vancouver, rented a bike there, packed my backpack, and headed for Alaska.

After several near-death collisions, I gave up and settled for Whistler. If you sit at a desk for twelve hours a day, don’t try to peddle a bike 80 miles uphill the next one. Thank me later. But Whistler has fresh air, LTE, and skiing in May, so I was happy. I watched the seaplanes take off over Green Lake and wondered what I was doing with my life. Such are the problems we have in the first world.

After taking stock of the situation, I decided to pursue the full-time occupation of chasing a girl halfway around the planet. That was a pretty good idea in hindsight. We met in Vancouver, in Austin, in New York, in Boston and Portland and everywhere in between, you name it and we were probably there for some event or meetup this May and June.

Planes. Trains. Automobiles. Every week was somewhere new. The daily milieu of new faces and scenes provided a welcome diversion to the reality of my situation. I chatted with Iranian barbers in Vancouver, lunched with captive bears on Grouse Mountain, had [good ramen](http://ramendanbo.com/) on Robson, explored castaway shipwrecks on False Creek, sat on the [largest chair](https://backofhouse.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/834/content_clift-BOH-chair-1.jpg) in San Fransisco, tested the [longest slide](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/arts/design/testing-new-york-citys-longest-slide-on-governors-island.html) in New York.

How does one afford to travel so much? The answer is, as frequent flyers will explain in hushed voices, with lots of credit cards. By the interest earned from delinquent debtors and with a little help from Uncle Sam, US banks will simply hand you fake currency, if you pay your credit card bills in a timely fashion, that may be used at various airlines and hotel chains.

In June, I boarded UA 149 to São Paulo International Airport with a couple hundred other Brazilians. That plane never arrived in São Paulo International Airport. Nor did any of the subsequent flights we were on. Instead they dropped us behind customs in Rio Galeão without food or water for eight hours. To my amazement, United Airlines did not seem to recognize any problem with this. All of the Brazilians just shrugged and laughed.

In São Paulo I had some [amazing milkshakes](https://twitter.com/breandan/status/750761636714151936), ate coxinhas and churrasco. I kept watch for police as my friend flew his drone around Ibirapuera Park to much public dismay, reassured fleeing bystanders, and in general did a whole lot of chasing down other people in São Paulo. I had [excellent ramen](http://lamenkazu.com.br/) in Liberdade. Somehow managed to give a coherent talk about machine learning. Or maybe not. English is not their first language.

In July, I fired my dentist. In hindsight, that was not a good idea. He was getting on my nerves with the appointment reminders, but he was a consummate professional, through and through. Dentists are good people, and even if they are a little fanatical about oral hygiene, they have your best interests at heart. You should see one regularly.

Later that month, I landed in Los Angeles. This was a big mistake. After breaking down in an antique automobile on I-15, I nearly perished from dehydration in the great suburban wasteland that lies east of LA, running to make an appointment with my father’s third ex-wife. Do not try to drive a car twice your age through the desert in summertime.

In August, after surviving another bout of food poisoning, I flew from LA to Bergen, Norway, by way of Dallas and London. The plan was to meet my girlfriend in Hamburg ten days later. Plenty of time to take the train from Bergen to Oslo to Stockholm to Malmö to København to Hamburg. Or so I thought.

I spent a day dodging lorries in a dodgy part of London on [Santander Cycles](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/santander-cycles), and eating [mediocre ramen](https://www.shoryuramen.com/stores/1-regent-street/categories) in Piccadilly Circus. After making my Heathrow connection with seconds to spare, I arrived in Bergen, still breathless, with my newly printed [Eurail pass](http://www.eurail.com/) proudly in hand to show the customs officer. He sighed, and stamped my passport.

The journey from Bergen to Oslo was simply otherworldly, filled with gaping Fjords, scenic vistas, glacial streams, and mountain passes. I sat next to a biologist studying seasonal migration patterns and teaching a summer seminar in Voss. I watched Norwegian villages and stations glide past my window. Norway is a breathtakingly gorgeous place.

Stayed with a rock band living in Oslo. They kindly loaned me their bicycle, which I put to extensive use exploring the neighboring countryside. There, I wandered into a surreal village that looked like it was from the 17th century. The townsfolk, dressed in period clothing, made pointed gestures at my bicycle while speaking in Norse. This was confusing, as I do not speak Norse and seemed to be only person from the 21st century that morning. I discovered it was a [historical reenactment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Museum_of_Cultural_History), filled with live actors and livestock. Nearby, is the [Royal farm of Norway](http://www.royalcourt.no/artikkel.html?tid=28703), stocked with heavily armed soldiers grazing in wide open pasture. I took the ferry back and ate some delicious Punjabi food for dinner.

I arrived in Stockholm late. The host was asleep, or forgot about my arrival. After accidentally waking up her neighbor and probably the whole apartment building, we arranged to meet a nice old lady, who apologized to everyone in Swedish, made some tea and introduced me to her city. Stockholm is a big park with a city attached. You can bike alongside people horsebacking through the woods. Have [lunch](http://www.rosendalstradgard.se/) in the middle of green fields. I went to a [television station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakn%C3%A4stornet) in the sky. Toured an [old warship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship)) dredged up from the bottom of the sea.

King of Sweden orders the largest warship ever built. Three masts. 64 guns. Topheavy, narrow-looking monstrosity. Two years to build the damn thing. Launches to much public fanfare. No ballast. Light breeze starts to blow in the harbor, and she sinks, killing thirty sailors. King starts an investigation. Everyone points up the chain of command, back to the King who rubber stamped the whole thing. Investigation quickly ends. Remind you of any software projects?

Malmö is an little city on the coast of southern Sweden. The area where I stayed had long rows of block-style housing with WWII-era bomb shelters underneath. They have a tall building called the [Turning Torso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Torso), visible from any point in the city and which my host pointed out enthusiastically. Disappointingly, it did not turn. Very windy and fairly chilly here in August. I rode to Øresund Bridge and returned for hot chocolate, then boarded the commuter train to København.

In København, I stayed with a marketing director for a particle accelerator somewhere in Sweden (apparently, big science projects need marketing people to help secure grants and so forth). He gave me directions to an pretty good [ramen place](http://ramentobiiru.dk/) nearby, and told me to visit a high-energy particle accelerator in Hamburg called DESY.

There exists a train from Copenhagen to Hamburg which has the distinction (unbeknownst to me at the time) of being a [boat train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat_train). So you can imagine my excitement to be suddenly sitting on such a train, aboard a [boat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogelfluglinie). They even gave us the opportunity to disembark from said train onto said boat, which I availed to great satisfaction.

My girlfriend met me in Hamburg. Much to her chagrin, my primary reason for visiting there was to see the [Miniatur Wunderland](http://www.miniatur-wunderland.com/). To her further chagrin, the second reason was now [DESY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DESY). This time, I went alone. I slipped into a small tour, lead by someone who looked important. Later I discovered the tour was in German, but by then it was too late to turn back. I nodded thoughtfully and continued to do so for the remaining three hours as we walked from one secure facility to the next. Crisis averted.

We then proceeded to visit a number of central European cities. Bonn for a week. Berlin for a few days. Potsdam for a day. Zürich for a day. Bern for a day. Lausanne for two. Zermatt and St. Moritz for a day. Salzburg for a week. Two days in Frankfurt. It was a whirlwind of trains, running to catch trains, finding our train was delayed, scrambling taxis to catch another train, etc. This required weeks of planning, but happily we made all of our scheduled connections, through careful chronological concentration.

Bonn is a quaint city with a surprising amount of trivia. Once home to Beethoven and former capital of Germany, it now houses the T-Mobile headquarters, Haribo, a large [solar conglomerate](https://www.solarworld-usa.com/), and has the [best scrambled eggs](http://www.midi-bonn.de/das-midi/) I have personally tasted. Met a geology student who wanted to visit America. I encouraged him to do so. Later, I tried [Club-Mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club-Mate) for the first time, and went to some good [talks at FrOSCon](https://media.ccc.de/c/froscon2016).

From what I gathered, Berlin is a very culturally diverse and hip place to be. Personally, I was more interested in the historical bits, but there is a lot to take in. There is [Shanghainese food](https://www.google.com/search?num=100&q=berlin+shanghainese+food&npsic=0&rflfq=1&rlha=0&rllag=52514292,13399547,5241&tbm=lcl&ved=0ahUKEwjmtLm3qI7RAhUr6IMKHcg8CoMQtgMIIQ&tbs=lf_msr:-1,lf_od:-1,lf_oh:-1,lf:1,lf_ui:9,lf_pqs:EAE#rlfi=hd:;si:;mv:!1m3!1d132595.8775997734!2d13.373693812304737!3d52.492941176095016!3m2!1i860!2i655!4f13.1), neat European bistros, foreign exchange students hopping gleefully with stories of their latest party, vast swaths of beautifully manicured parks, loads of history. You could spend weeks here. Unfortunately, I only had a few days.

It was in Berlin where I began to appreciate the cultural differences between Germany and America. In the US we are outwardly warm, sometimes overtly so. Germans are outwardly cold, but inwardly warm and caring. These differences may cause some misunderstanding. You may think a German is being curt, or rude. Do not fret. Germans are very kind, once you get to know one.

There is a monument in the middle of Berlin, which you should visit, called [Neue Wache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neue_Wache). On a boulevard full of pompous looking buildings, it looks like any other. But if you take a moment to step inside, it will catch you off guard. Behind iron bars and beneath a hole in the roof sits a mother cradling her dead son. There are thousands of war memorials with huge guns. Go here instead.

Potsdam is nice to visit if you like palaces and gardens. I took the S-Bahn to Potsdam, rented a bike there, and rode for hours through the park. Later, I returned to Berlin and visited the [Olympiastadion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiastadion_(Berlin)), a very impressive piece of architecture, accessible from the same line. But even if you’re not into stuffy old castles, you should visit Potsdam, because it is a very peaceful place indeed.

After a brief episode of frantically running around Berlin, chasing down a taxi, swerving to avoid oncoming traffic, and scrambling around the station to find our platform, we leapt aboard the [City Night Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Night_Line) to Zürich, luggage and all, as they closed their doors and whistled to beat the band. The conductor tapped on his watch crossly. It was all very [Wes Anderson-Esque](https://youtu.be/8Q6YqCRMwEI?t=75), except far less fun.

We awoke to the Zürich sunshine in August, and quickly realized the sun can be very hot under prolonged exposure. Storing our luggage in the train station, we got Muesli for breakfast, walked around the [river baths](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/ssd/de/index/sport/schwimmen/sommerbaeder/flussbad_unterer_letten/adresse.secure.html), had fish at Nordsee, a German fast food chain. You probably wouldn’t associate fresh fish with fast food, but it is surprisingly palatable. Then it was time to go to Bern.

Bern has some [very](http://www.bindella.ch/de/kornhauskeller.html) [good](http://www.entrecote.ch/) [restaurants](http://www.rosengarten.be/welcome/) which I highly recommend visiting if you have the time and inclination. We toured the [Einstein House](http://www.einstein-bern.ch/), strolled through the Rose Garden, peered into a bear bit, dipped our feet into the icy blue river, and did a good bit of touristy sounding things. Switzerland is a marvelous place if you have never been there before.

Geneva is the home of CERN, which is mainly why we went there. You need to book a [guided tour](https://visit.cern/tours/guided-tours-individuals) two weeks in advance, which gets reserved within a few minutes of new availability each day, so be prepared to mash <code>F5</code> 15 days before your arrival. The group self-selects for scientifically literate people, and the guide knew particle physics, so the tour is technically very educational.

From Geneva, we took a train to Visp, and up to Zermatt via a special railway that clings to the moutain, between cliffside dwellings perched on dubious-looking foundations. Out of an abundance of caution, we avoided a similar funicular excursion just a few days earlier, due to [large earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_2016_Central_Italy_earthquake) that had recently struck central Italy.

The town of Zermatt is only accessible by train, which is a good thing, because we had no other way to get up there. However this means it is inaccessible when there are slides or avalanches. Fortunately, there were no recent slides or avalanches, and we arrived without incident. Stayed at the [Best Western](http://www.alpenresort.com/en/welcome/) (a great chain in Switzerland) and watched the sun set over the peak of the Matterhorn.

The next morning, we left bright and early on the [Glacier Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier_Express), the slowest high speed train in the world. Scenic waypoints are narrated in dulcet sing-song, like a person reading children’s fairy tale, in English, German, Italian, French and possibly Romansh. We passed through steep mountain passes, sweeping valleys, and trestles over deep gorges.

Arriving in St. Moritz later that afternoon, we hauled our bags a kilometer uphill into a [hotel above a pizza shop](http://www.arte-stmoritz.ch/), sauntered by the lake while people maneuvered small sailboats, and watched tuxedo-clad chaps [jump horses](http://www.csistmoritz.ch/) over fences in the late summer sunshine. It was all spectacularly European. St. Moritz is very extravagant, dripping with fur, fast cars and grand old hotels.

Then we took a train to Salzburg, by way of Zürich. Austria was really interesting, and much more down-to-earth than Switzerland. I grew up watching The Sound of Music every Christmas, so there was an immediate connection. We also had a week in one place, so were able to get to know our surroundings much better.

If you have never been, Salzburg is a town on a river, as many European towns are prone to be. More importantly, it has an abundance of salt. Salt was once the currency of the day, back in the day, hence the English, *salary*. This means that Salzburg was a very wealthy place when salt was the legal tender, and accumulated a great deal of castles and aristocratic types through the taxation and export of salt along the river.

One of these was the Archbishop of Salzburg, Markus Sittikus, who by all accounts was not a very pleasant person, but hey, times were different. He built a large estate, known as [Hellbrunn Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellbrunn_Palace), containing many cruel hydraulic innovations. To this day, guides use his collection to torment passing tourists.

After spending a number of pleasant days touring the lakes and mountains surrounding Salzburg, riding gondolas, watching people fling themselves off the mountainside, catching rare Pokemon and Mozart concerts in the park, we waved goodbye to Austria and made great haste for Frankfurt.

I commandeered a [Car2Go](https://www.car2go.com) on the Frankfurt autobahn, a road that has no speed limits, beside those required by the laws of physics. This was fortunate, as we were short on time. Unfortunately, the laws of physics have set a very low speed limit for Cars2Go, so it ended up taking quite a while. But once you finally park the thing, you're right next to the check-in counter.

Spent a week in San Jose at the beginning of September, and saw some great talks at Cassandra Summit. Cassandra is a pretty cool technology if you have truly enormous amounts of data to store. Maybe by the time this blog post is finished I will have a legitimate use case.

Rented a car on Friday and drove south for the weekend. If you have a special weekend enterprise and are looking for transportation, use the [Enterprise Weekend Special](https://www.enterprise.com/en/car-rental/deals/weekend-specials.html). They'll pick you up anywhere but the airport and you'll pay more for gas than the car.
 
Monterey is the home of John Steinbeck, and the setting for many of his novels. John is a great writer. But he doesn't do it justice. The coastline is indescribable. You can run on warm beaches in the Caramel Highlands and walk through quiet stands of Coast Redwood in Big Sur. Go there, you will not regret it.

Flew to Boston and back the next weekend for JavaOne. Taught some kids about cryptography with an American Indian. Indian American? A friend from India, who lives in the US. Went for a nice bike ride to Sausalito with some speakers from Switzerland, a contractor for the Patent Office, a developer from Ireland. Took the ferry back. Had fair bowl of ramen.

Each year, Oracle swoops into downtown San Fransisco like Christmas in September and paints everything red and white. Flies racing yachts in by crane and blocks off city streets. The last few years, they built a carnival complete with ferris wheel and free food, fireworks, Elton John, then bussed ten thousand people out to an island in the bay for an all-night bacchanalian celebration. This year, they went for conservative and opted to use the baseball stadium.
