title: Trust in Automation

---

*In which I discuss the trouble with trusting machines to take our jobs, curate our news feeds, drive our school buses, teach our children, and lots of boring stuff too difficult to bother doing ourselves. Oh, and quotes. Lots of quotes.*

Houston, we have a problem. According to social media, a large fraction of our population will soon be unemployed. Not just unemployed, but [unemployable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU). Thanks to rapid growth in the software industry and recent breakthroughs in automation and machine learning, a majority of the world's human labor will be economically obsolete. Too young to retire, and too old to retrain, there will be an enormous displacement of unskilled labor. This is not just idle speculation. Leading [scientists](https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg/status/815342695321174017) and [politicians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72bHop6AIcc) have recognized the immediacy of this problem, and the importance of addressing it in our society.

Automation does not just affect unskilled laborers. Many jobs which require advanced degrees and years of experience are vulnerable, including a large number of doctors, lawyers, architects and accountants. Each of these professions does work which is already being learned, automated, and optimized by machines. Even [mathematical research](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6280-deepmath-deep-sequence-models-for-premise-selection.pdf) at the boundaries of our understanding can be [automated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qT8NyyRgLDQ). Today a growing number of mathematicians use [interactive proof assistants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant) and [automated theorem provers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving) to verify their proofs, and even derive [new truths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_proof#List_of_theorems_proved_with_the_help_of_computer_programs). But if [current events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news_websites_in_the_United_States) are any indication, what is true and what is verifiable are entirely [different matters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability,_not_truth).

> And when your surpassing creations find the answers you asked for, you can't understand their analysis and you can't verify their answers. You have to take their word on faith—Or you use information theory to flatten it for you, to squash the tesseract into two dimensions and the Klein bottle into three, to simplify reality and pray to whatever Gods survived the millennium that your honorable twisting of the truth hasn't ruptured any of its load-bearing pylons. You hire people like me; the crossbred progeny of profilers and proof assistants and information theorists...

> In formal settings you'd call me Synthesist.

> —Peter Watts, Blindsight (2006)

Peter Watts', in his breakout science-fiction novel, "[Blindsight](http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm)", imagines the possibility of professional *synthesists*. In a future where most scientific breakthroughs are achieved by AI, synthesists "explain the incomprehensible to the indifferent." Watts' protagonist, Siri Keaton is a spacefaring science officer who intercepts a [Matrioshka brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain) outside the solar system. Siri is tasked with collecting observations and verifying the true nature of this strange object. But as Siri soon realizes, not all truths can be verified...

Futurist sci-fi tends to fall into three broad categories. The optimists dream of a post-scarcity utopia where technology descends like manna from AI heaven, and we all travel into some digital promised land, *en masse* so to speak. The pessimists argue that robot overlords and evil mega-corporations will vie for control of a dystopian future where humans are mostly expendable. And the synergists suggest a hybrid future, where humans and machines co-exist in relative happiness, clinging to the hope we possess some vestigial importance to our metallic brethren. These thought experiments serve an important function as we grapple with the increasing effects of automation.

> People think—wrongly—that speculative fiction is about predicting the future… What speculative fiction is really good at is not the future but the present—taking an aspect of it that troubles or is dangerous, and extending and extrapolating that aspect into something that allows the people of that time to see what they are doing from a different angle and from a different place. It’s cautionary.

Science fiction, or speculative fiction as some prefer, has a long history of anticipating current events, and takes lessons from past and present alike. In one remarkable passage of [The Three Body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem), a man called Von Neumann helps an ancient Chinese emperor build a computer to predict the movements of stars across the sky. With the Emperor's permission, he trains millions of soldiers to form logic gates and memory buses, instructing them to raise and lower flags and march around a vast plain. Wherever an error occurs, the emperor simply executes everyone involved and trains new replacements.

> Qin Shi Huang lifted the sword to the sky, and shouted: “Computer Formation!” Four giant bronze cauldrons at the corners of the platform came to life simultaneously with roaring flames. A group of soldiers standing on the sloping side of the pyramid facing the phalanx chanted in unison: “Computer Formation!”
>
> On the ground below, colors in the phalanx began to shift and move. Complicated and detailed circuit patterns appeared and gradually filled the entire formation. Ten minutes later, the army had made a thirty-six kilometer square computer motherboard...
>
> “This is really interesting,” Qin Shi Huang said, pointing to the spectacular sight. “Each individual’s behavior is so simple, yet together, they can produce such a complex, great whole! Europeans criticize me for my tyrannical rule, claiming that I suppress creativity. But in reality, a large number of men yoked by severe discipline can also produce great wisdom when bound together as one.”

> —Cixin Liu, The Three Body Problem (2008)

Cixin Liu is a sci-fi writer[ˆ2] in China. It is not difficult to see parallels between Liu's armies and the legions of migrant workers toiling in Chinese factories to build the machines that will soon replace them. China is not the only country facing pressure from machines. Many countries with large manufacturing sectors are hugely threatened by the destabilizing presence of automation. As soon as you teach a robot to sew sweaters more cheaply than paying a human, suddenly every sweater-factory can run lights-out, 24/7, displacing thousands of workers overnight. While we're at it, why bother shipping the goods half way around the world to begin with?

> As the cost of labor goes up and the cost of machinery goes down, at some point, it’ll be cheaper to use machines than people. With the increase in productivity, the GDP goes up, but so does unemployment. What do you do? ... The best way is to reduce the time a certain portion of the population spends living, and then find ways to keep them busy.

But job displacement, while a major challenge, is not the real problem facing our species. As history has shown, humanity has survived dozens of technological upheavals. In the agricultural revolution, nomadic hunter-gatherers started breeding their prey, growing their forage, wheeling their food into little villages. The industrial revolution enlisted those farmers as factory workers and foremen inside village-sized machines that consumed raw materials and produced smaller machines. Our ancestors saw sweeping social and economic change and built huge civilizations in the process, despite their share of contemporary detractors. *So what is the problem exactly?*

> For too many of us, it's become safer to retreat into our own bubbles, whether in our neighborhoods or on college campuses, or places of worship, or especially our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions. The rise of naked partisanship, and increasing economic and regional stratification, the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste — all this makes this great sorting seem natural, even inevitable. And increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it's true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there.

> —Barack Obama, Farewell Address (2016)

At the dawn of the information age, we were confident a new-fangled technology called the "internet" would be superior to old-fashioned forms of media. The growth of the internet would give voices to the voiceless and choices to the choiceless. It was a media frontier where consumers had the ability to create and curate content according to their own tastes and desires. No longer was television the sole source of our daily entertainment. Suddenly, you could read whatever you pleased and tweet whenever you sneezed. Isn't it great? We can share new ideas and opinions with ease. Even your boss agrees, let's retweet and reshare this with him overseas!

The internet ushered a great awakening in this new age of information. Politicians and philosophers from ancient Rome could only dream of the meritocracy that instant access to unlimited information would one day bring to all humankind. What they could not foresee, is how the internet would usher in a new kind of tyranny, one that would eclipse any government's misuse in the name of security. Instant access does not guarantee self-improvement, only the promise of easy gratification. Unlimited information does not reveal deeper truth, only an endless road of distractions. Without education, the internet is a tyranny of the mind. Without purpose, it is a prison.

> Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.

*"A prison?"* you might say. *"Why, it's full of shiny gadgets, great entertainment, and people who agree with me. That doesn't sound so bad - I rather like it here!"* Those shiny gadgets are [Skinner boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber). The entertainment? [Viral memes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme), waiting to infect your mind and eat your attention span. Those other people? They're just [reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble) who [echo our opinions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)), inflate our egos, and [confirm our biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias). The prison wardens are very good at keeping us fat and happy. The best part is, we don't even need to ask. The can model our habits, predict our behavior, anticipate our desires. They can practically read our minds.

All this sounds rather dire, and perhaps it is a bit hyperbolic. Don't trust anything you read on the internet. The problem is, the internet provides opportunity and oppression, education and entertainment, truth and fiction, all in equal measure. *The problem is, each of these things looks exactly like the other.* How is a color-blind chap in the Matrix supposed to know [which pill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pill_and_blue_pill) to swallow? Should we just take Morpheus at his word? As it happens, when dealing with black boxes that can read your mind, this problem becomes surprisingly difficult.

> If our brains were simple enough for us to understand them, we'd be so simple that we couldn't.

Researchers have poured millions of dollars into an area of machine learning called [explainable AI](http://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence). So far as we can tell, it can't be explained. Sure, we know how to build them using GPUs and gigabytes of data. We use fancy words like backpropogation, gradient-descent, convolutions, and hyperparameters. We can poke and prod them, try a zillion different settings and sometimes they become more accurate. And we know that they work very well. For most people that is enough. But why does one AI classify you as a criminal and me as an upstanding citizen? Because your face looks kind of criminal-ish?

Automated criminality inference based on facial images is a [real thing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04135), and [not just in China](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing). Although many flaws exist in these systems, the underlying assumptions are probably correct. With this kind of technology, if it works, somebody will find a way to use it. But even if AIs could explain their logic, the problem is not the algorithms themselves. The problem is those who are willing to apply them indiscriminately, regardless of whether they understand the rules. If some algorithm is 45% confident you're going to default on your home loan, the bank isn't going to debug their lending bot unless it approves a false negative, or there is a shortage of loan applicants (there won't be). The incentives are not aligned in your favor.

If you think discrimination is bad today, just wait until the machines take over. They will discriminate based on the the shade of your iris, the shape of your brow, or any arbitrary collection of low-level traits whose presence exceeds a subtle bias threshold. Regardless whether such traits are truly predictive, it will not matter unless those running the show have an incentive to fix the model. For most applications, AI just needs to be good enough to yield a positive [marginal utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility). Barring blatant discrimination on parameters like sex or skin color, most biases (accidental or otherwise) will fly under the radar.

# Believe in Bias

> Treating the world as software promotes fantasies of control. And the best kind of control is control without responsibility. Our unique position as authors of software used by millions gives us power, but we don't accept that this should make us accountable. We're programmers—who else is going to write the software that runs the world? To put it plainly, we are surprised that people seem to get mad at us for trying to help.
>
> Fortunately we are smart people and have found a way out of this predicament. Instead of relying on algorithms, which we can be accused of manipulating for our benefit, we have turned to machine learning, an ingenious way of disclaiming responsibility for anything. **Machine learning is like money laundering for bias.** It's a clean, mathematical apparatus that gives the status quo the aura of logical inevitability.

As [experience](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/04/the-underlying-bias-of-facial-recognition-systems/476991/) has [shown](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/08/artificial-intelligence-beauty-contest-doesnt-like-black-people), anticipating mistakes when you design the AI is difficult enough, never mind verifying its integrity as a subject. If you even know the AI exists begin with. But let's say you have knowledge of such a program, a deep background in statistics, and an API to query the model. If the designer is not careful, you might just be able to [steal the model](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_tramer.pdf), and check it yourself. That's a lot of "if"s. The average end-user has little hope of verifying the fairness of an AI, and no incentive to do so unless they are unfairly targeted. If you are unfairly targeted by an AI, the incentives are not in your favor.

Let's suppose you are unfairly targeted. The lawsuit-worthy cases are going to be heavily tested prior to release, and the easy-lawsuits will be settled early, to avoid the appearance of discrimination.

> Trust, but verify.

> -[Some Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify)

The problem is not the algorithm. The problem is the data set, and the implementation. The people training these models are college dropouts and software developers, not geniuses. If you're lucky, maybe some of us took an online course in machine learning. There should be some kind of independent evaluation system put into place, to verify big models are free from bias. Knowing developers, if we create a monster, it will most likely be out of [stupidity than malice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor).

While we're on the subject of statistics, let's talk a little about bias. "Bias" in machine learning sense is not always a bad word.

If you are designing AI in a new domain, ask yourself three important questions:

1. Are we really measuring what we want to measure? (Construct validity)
    - Many advertisers just try to maximize clicks. This is a [bad idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_fraud).
    - Objectives may change over the production lifetime of a model.
    - A poorly chosen objective can have [unintended consequences](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer).
2. Is the training data accurate and free from hidden bias? (Internal validity)
    - If the labeling method is biased, the model will encode its bias.
    - The sample population may be skewed for various [reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_validity).
    - Your training data may not be [partitioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_set) correctly.
3. Is the training data representative of the production data? (External validity)
    - Maybe the true population is not the population we trained for.
    - Maybe the training set is not large enough for valid results.
    - Maybe the model is missing data on some key demographic.

# Work in Progress

Machine learning has many benign use cases, from eye-tracking to handwriting recognition. Good things that will improve humanity.

One of the major limitations of user interfaces is bandwidth - keyboards and screens can only exchange so much information with their users. But today's computers have the ability to interact with their environment in exciting new ways. From self-flying drones to virtual patients, and home appliances to smart assistants, machines are becoming increasingly perceptive, and increasingly conversant. Machines can see, hear, and understand natural language. They can recognize faces and speech, anticipate our intentions and assist with increasingly sophisticated tasks. We call these capabilities "artificial intelligence". But a more apt name might be "[augmented intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_amplification)".
