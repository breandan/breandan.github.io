        \opening{Dear Prof. Blanchette, Prof. Kemme and members of the hiring comittee,}
        As a Ph.D. student under the supervision of Prof. Guo, I am currently studying the application of computer-aided reasoning for knowledge-enhanced software connectivity. Last month, I was called upon by Prof. Pientka to interview Xujie Si, a faculty candidate under consideration at the School of Computer Science.\\\\
        Xujie and I first met at the 31st Neural Information Processing Systems conference in 2017. I was struck by the originality of Xujie's work, which showed a genuine appreciation for programming language theory in a conference almost exclusively dedicated to machine learning. Since then, we have interacted at a number of PL and ML conferences, where I have been consistently impressed by his openmindedness, creativity and curiosity--driven approach to research.\\\\
        As a graduate student in the McGill community since 2017, I have had the pleasure of interviewing a number of highly talented candidates here and at the University of Montr\'eal. Among them, Xujie stands out in his unique blend of ideas from classical computer science and statistical learning theory. From my interactions with him over the last few years, I have no doubt he would make an outstanding mentor and am happy to recommend him without any reservations.\\
        \closing{Sincerely,\\
